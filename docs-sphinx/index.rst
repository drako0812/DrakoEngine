   :alt: Documentation Status

A modern C++ game engine using a high-performance Entity-Component-System
architecture. Also, *Drako Engine* should be considered a programmer-first
engine, not to say that designer and artist features won't be added, they are
just a secondary concern. This is mostly because the initial target audience for
*Drako Engine* is for lone developers like myself.
