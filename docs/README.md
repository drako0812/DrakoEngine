# Drako Engine

A modern C++ game engine using a high-performance Entity-Component-System
architecture. Also, *Drako Engine* should be considered a programmer-first engine,
not to say that designer and artist features won't be added, they are just a secondary
concern. This is mostly because the initial target audience for *Drako Engine*
is for lone developers like myself.
